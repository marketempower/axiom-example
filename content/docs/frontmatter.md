Custom Axiom Frontmatter fields for Hugo.

__Private__: Exclude a piece of Content from Robots indexing, Sitemaps, and Feeds.

```yaml
+++
private = true
+++
```

Useful for Pages such as 404, Privacy Policy, or Disclosures that you don't want indexed.

__Feature__: Add a Featured image to a piece of Content.

```yaml
+++
# Using path plus filename
feature = "image/uploads/file.jpg"

# Using 'public_id' (uuid), instead of filename
feature = "5e39e315-c06c-4d81-9b4a-35fca661621c"
+++
```

> Remember to output the image in the size set in the _Image_ Config (`params.image` `width` and `height`) option and store it locally or on a CDN. See the _Image_ section in the [Configuration]({{< relref "configuration" >}}) for details.

__Caption__: Add a Caption to a Featured image.

```yaml
+++
caption = "Feature image caption and image alt text."
+++
```

__Author__: Author of the Content.

```yaml
+++
# Author Id from /data/author.toml
author = "default"
+++
```

See the _Author_ section in the [Configuration]({{< relref "configuration" >}}) for details.

__Subtitle__: Short blurb enhancing the Content's _Title_. Used in the Structured Data `alternativeHeadline` field and in Content Summaries.

```yaml
+++
subtitle = "Suggested 25 words / 125 chars. Used in metadata, Post Page, and Content summaries."
+++
```

SEO potential, write something relevant.

__Summary__: Summary and Meta Description of the Content. Used in Section Pages, Summery Pages, Meta, Open-Graph, and Structured Data `description` fields. Affected by Hugo's Config variable `summaryLength` which defaults to `70`.

```yaml
+++
summary = "Summary, and meta description. Automatically generated by Hugo's 'Summary' function if not provided. Longer than Summary, with more detail, typically 70 words more or less."
+++
```

SEO potential, write something relevant.
